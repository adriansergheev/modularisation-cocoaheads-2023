/*:
 # What is the key difficulty?
 * Upfront work & Untangling dependencies
 ***
 # Why should you care?
 - Code Configuration: Package.swift > Xcode UI
 - Faster Compile Times: Parallelized builds
 - Maintenance & Debugging: Fast dev cycle, run separate "feature" apps
 - Developer Experience: Less stress on Xcode
 - Flexibility: Compile heavy dependencies only when needed
 - Collaboration: Work on features without affecting others
 - Code Boundaries: Proper access control, explicit dependencies
